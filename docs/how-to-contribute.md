### ii. Bug Reporting
if you find a bug, please report it to the Nebulas team. Bugs may be found on Nebulas testnet, mainnet, nebPay, neb.js, web wallet, as well as other tools and documentation. We will follow OWASP Risk Assessment System to calculate the corresponding bounty/reward based on the risk degree of the bug. Bugs with high risk will be rewarded 150 NAS+, medium risk 50 NAS+ and low risk 10 NAS+. No capped.

Every time we launch a new function, we will first deploy it on our testnet. Currently, we have launched our first new function on the Nebulas testnet and everyone is welcome to try it, report any found bugs and receive the corresponding reward. The first of many new functions in public beta on the testnet is the inter-contract function.
